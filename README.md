⏳ Time Series Forecasting in Python

📌 Overview

This project demonstrates the use of time series analysis and forecasting techniques in Python to predict future values based on historical trends. It includes a complete pipeline from data preparation and visualization to model building and evaluation using statistical methods and machine learning.

🔍 Objectives

Analyze temporal data for trends and seasonality

Apply statistical tests to check stationarity

Build predictive models like ARIMA for forecasting

Evaluate and visualize forecast accuracy

🛠️ Tools & Libraries

Python

Pandas, NumPy

Matplotlib, Seaborn

statsmodels

scikit-learn

Jupyter Notebook

📈 Key Techniques

Time series decomposition (trend, seasonality, residuals)

ADF (Augmented Dickey-Fuller) test for stationarity

ACF & PACF plots for model parameter selection

Forecasting using ARIMA/SARIMA models

Model evaluation using RMSE, MAPE, etc.

📁 Files Included

Time_Series_Forecasting.ipynb – Main notebook with full analysis and modeling

Dataset.csv – Dataset used for time series analysis (rename if needed)

🎯 Outcome

The project provides a practical approach to forecasting future values using statistical models, which can be applied to domains such as sales prediction, inventory management, and financial planning.
